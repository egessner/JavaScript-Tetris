# JavaScript-Tetris
Simple Tetris written in Java Script

This is a simple JS adaptation of Tetirs. 
I admit that I don't have much experience playing Tetris so some standard gameplay may be missing.

**INSTALL:**

*Using git:*

Clone the repo to your local machine and continue onto startup

*Using ZIP (noob mode)*

Click green '<>Code' button then 'Download ZIP' unzip and continue onto startup

**STARTUP:**

Open index.html in any ES6 supported Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc..) and you're good to go.

**GAMEPLAY**:

Using a keyboard, **W** to rotate, **A**&**D** to move, **S** for soft fall, **Q** for hard drop. The **Restart** button restarts the game.

**DEV NOTES:**

My goal with creating this was to have fun and do something i've never done before - write a simple game from scratch

Enjoy - Erik
